I worked on this project in the data science course I took at IBM, reviewing the code line by line and testing different options. 
The dataset for this project is also available as a URL in the notebook.

What I learned from this project:
- Data cleaning
- Decision trees
- Model building
- Model evaluation and testing
- Comparing results
