This project aims to process data from recipe websites obtained from three different sources. In this project, as part of the data science course I took at IBM, I worked on it by examining the code line by line and trying out different options. 
The goal of this project: is to learn how to build models using existing data and evaluate the models we created. 

What I learned from this project includes:
- Data cleaning
- Decision trees
- Model building
- Model evaluation and testing
- Comparing results
