This project aims to process data from recipe websites obtained from three different sources. In this project, as part of the data science course I took at IBM, I worked on it by examining the code line by line and trying out different options. The dataset for this project is also available as a URL in the notebook. The goal of this project was to learn how to build models using existing data and evaluate the models we created. 

What I learned from this project includes:
Data cleaning
Decision trees
Model building
Model evaluation and testing
Comparing results
